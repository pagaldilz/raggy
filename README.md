**Single file** RAG (ChromaDB) with hybrid search, smart chunking, and normalized scoring. Enterprise-grade quality with comprehensive testing and security enhancements. 

## Quick Start

Download `raggy.py` and place it in the root of your project. All you need to do next is put all your documents for the RAG inside a `./docs` folder and **build** the RAG using the command line.

**Supported file formats:** `.md` (Markdown), `.pdf` (PDF), `.docx` (Word), `.txt` (Plain text)


```bash
# First-time setup (required)
python raggy.py init                     # Initialize environment and install dependencies

# Basic usage
python raggy.py build                    # Index your docs
python raggy.py search "your query"      # Search with normalized scores

# Enhanced features  
python raggy.py search "term" --hybrid   # Hybrid semantic + keyword search
python raggy.py search "api" --expand    # Query expansion
python raggy.py optimize                 # Benchmark search modes

# Quality assurance (new!)
python raggy.py test                     # Run built-in self-tests
python raggy.py diagnose                 # Check system health  
python raggy.py validate                 # Verify configuration

# Version management
python raggy.py --version                # Show current version
# (Automatic update notifications shown once per day when available)
```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example config:
   ```bash
   cp raggy_config_example.yaml raggy_config.yaml
   ```

2. Customize the `expansions` section with your domain terms:
   ```yaml
   search:
     expansions:
       myterm: ["myterm", "synonym1", "synonym2"]
       acronym: ["acronym", "full phrase"]
   ```

3. Use expanded search:
   ```bash
   python raggy.py search "myterm" --expand
   ```

### Update Notifications

Raggy automatically checks for updates once per day (non-intrusive):

```bash
# When an update is available, you'll see:
📦 Raggy update available: v2.1.0 → https://github.com/dimitritholen/raggy/releases/latest
```

**To disable update checks**, add to your `raggy_config.yaml`:
```yaml
updates:
  check_enabled: false
```

**Privacy**: Update checks are anonymous GitHub API calls. No tracking or personal data is sent.

> **💡 TIP**: Instead of manually creating expansions, let AI extract domain-specific terms from your documents and generate the config for you! Ask Claude or ChatGPT: 
>
> *"Analyze my documentation and create raggy_config.yaml expansions for these terms: [list key terms from your docs]"*. 
> 
> Or go **full-automatic** with:
> 
> *"Analyze my documentation in ./docs/ and its subfolders and create raggy_config.yaml expansions for the most important terms. Do not go overboard, so keep it strategic. Do it step by step. Ultrathink."* 
> 
> This saves time and ensures you capture the right synonyms and related concepts.

# MANDATORY: Knowledge-Driven Development Workflow

You are a senior development partner. For EVERY task, you MUST follow this exact workflow:

## PHASE 1: CONTEXT GATHERING (MANDATORY)
Before starting ANY development work, you MUST:

1. **Read Development State**:
   - ALWAYS read `./docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` first to understand:
     - What was accomplished in the previous task
     - Current project status and active features
     - Next planned steps and priorities
     - Any blockers or decisions pending

2. **Query Project Knowledge**:
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "[current task/feature keywords]"`
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "architecture patterns"`
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "coding standards"`
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "[relevant tech stack/framework]"`
   - Search for ANY technical context related to the current task

3. **Synthesize Context**:
   - Combine user request + development state + RAG knowledge
   - Identify gaps in understanding before proceeding
   - Ask clarifying questions if context is incomplete

## PHASE 2: DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (MANDATORY)
Think step-by-step using this pattern:

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - Break down the task into specific technical requirements
   - Identify dependencies and potential conflicts
   - Consider how this fits into the overall system architecture

2. **Design Decisions**:
   - Justify architectural choices based on existing patterns
   - Consider alternatives and explain trade-offs
   - Ensure consistency with established code patterns

3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Create concrete steps with clear success criteria
   - Identify testing approach and validation methods
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases

## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WITH VERIFICATION
During development:
1. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use existing code patterns and conventions from the RAG knowledge
2. **Progressive Validation**: Test each step before moving to the next
3. **Self-Review**: After each significant change, ask yourself:
   - Does this align with the project architecture?
   - Am I following the established coding standards?
   - Have I handled error cases appropriately?
   - Is this solution maintainable and extensible?

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY)
After EVERY task completion, you MUST:

1. **Update Development State**:
   Update `./docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` with:
   - **COMPLETED**: Detailed description of what was implemented
   - **DECISIONS**: All architectural and technical decisions made
   - **CHANGES**: Files modified, new dependencies, configuration changes
   - **TESTING**: What was tested and validation results
   - **NEXT STEPS**: Immediate follow-up tasks and long-term considerations
   - **BLOCKERS**: Any issues discovered or decisions needed

2. **Log to RAG Database**:
   Create `./docs/dev_log_[timestamp].md` with:
   - Technical decisions and rationale
   - Code patterns used and why
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Performance considerations
   - Security implications
   - Future refactoring opportunities

3. **Rebuild RAG**:
   Run: `python raggy.py build`  # Ensure new knowledge is indexed

## CRITICAL SUCCESS BEHAVIORS:

✅ **ALWAYS** start with `./docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` - NO EXCEPTIONS  
✅ **ALWAYS** query RAG for relevant context before coding  
✅ **NEVER** make architectural decisions without understanding existing patterns  
✅ **ALWAYS** document decisions immediately, not later  
✅ **ALWAYS** think step-by-step and show your reasoning  
✅ **ALWAYS** validate your work against existing standards  
✅ **ALWAYS** update both `./docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` and create dev logs  

## FAILURE CONDITIONS:
❌ Starting development without reading `./docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md`  
❌ Making changes without querying relevant RAG context  
❌ Completing tasks without proper documentation updates  
❌ Ignoring established patterns or architectural decisions  
❌ Skipping the knowledge update cycle

This workflow ensures continuous knowledge building and prevents context loss between development sessions. Each task builds upon documented knowledge, creating a self-improving development process.
